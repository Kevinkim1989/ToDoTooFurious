DEVELOPER NOTE
[START OF DEVELOPER NOTE] Unless noted as a DEVELOPER NOTE, assume everything else is written primarily by ChatGPT. The name, JS framework, decision to make a Task Manager was the primary prompt. The rest of the code is written and iterated upon by ChatGPT using it's own suggestions after prompting a code review. This is a working MVP.

I've also prompted for it to apply SAFe best practices when estimating the level of work, mostly for fun, but just to see if it could.

It would be interesting to see if I can make a different chain of prompts to run it through a simulated rituals like backlog planning, feature writing etc.

[END OF DEVELOPER NOTE]

This is a simple to-do list app built with React. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The tasks are saved to local storage, so they will persist even if the user refreshes the page or closes the browser.

Usage
To use the app, simply enter a task title and description, and click the "Add Task" button. The task will be added to the list, and you can click the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons to update or remove the task.

Development
